Song guessing battle….

Premise: 

Load into the website, choose name, avatar etc.
Share invite link to friend who you want to battle
You each select a song that the other person has to guess
Songs are selected from a menu, sorted by genre, top artists, etc.
You are then inside the game where you see empty boxes for the song name (like hangman)
Enter guesses into the chatbox
As time passes, letters are filled in to help you guess.



What makes the game different than others:

Inside the game, there will be a shop/reveal menu
To gain shop currency, you can reveal/send over helpful clues to your opponent 
Clues can be things like… Album cover, Genre, Individual letters, Audio snippet (3-10 seconds)
The more helpful the clue is, the more points you are rewarded
Points can be used in the shop to buy clues for yourself


How a game might play out…

Player 1 invites Player 2 to join a game (similar to scribbl.io invite link)
Player 1 chooses Creep by Radiohead, Player 2 chooses Poker Face by lady gaga

Player 1 sees:     _ _ _ _ r   _ a _ e
Player 2 sees:     _ r _ _ _
(amt of letters pre-filled determined by length of song name)

Player 1 selects the reveal menu and sends over the album cover for 50pts 
Player 2 now has the album cover filled in next to their song 
Player 1 selects the shop menu and buys a 5 second audio snippet for 50pts
Player 2 selects reveal menu and reveals/sends 3 letters for 30 pts
Player 1 would now see P _ k _ r   F a _ e
Player 2 selects the shop menu and buys 3 second audio snipped for 30pts
